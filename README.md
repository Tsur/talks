# Tech Talks

Teaching is a great, transforming experience we should all try at least once in our lifetime. Below you may find a list of talks I made sometimes just for myself, for my family or for my workmates.  


* The JavaScript Runetime: An Initiation Ceremony ...

  Have you ever heard about Runes ? Do you know what it is ? ... ok, it's like a ancient language and knowledge, pretty hard to understand, to acquire, that let you make wonders. It's like magic ! But we all are serious engineers who do not believe in magic and things like that, right? so I'm gonna talk rather about something much more interesting, the JavaScript Runtime. But before teaching others I wanted to make sure I was aligned with most serious senior JavaScript engineers (who do not believe in magic and things like that) and they all agree in that the JavaScript Runtime is "something like, like ... an ancient knowledge, pretty hard to understand and to acquire. It's like, like magic ... "

  Keep by my side in this magical journey where we will go from the JavaScript RuneTime to the JavaScript Runtime and will unveil its magic !
