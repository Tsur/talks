# Tech Talks

Teaching is a great, transforming experience we should all try at least once in our lifetime. Below you may find a list of talks I made sometimes just for myself, for my family or for my workmates.  

## The JavaScript Runetime: An Initiation Ceremony ...

  Have you ever heard about Runes ? Do you know what it is ? ... yeah it's like a ancient language and knowledge, pretty hard to understand, to acquire, that let you make wonders. It's like magic ! But we all are serious engineers who do not believe in magic and things like that, right? so I'm gonna talk rather about something much more interesting, the JavaScript Runtime. But before teaching others I wanted to make sure I was aligned with most serious senior JavaScript engineers (who do not believe in magic and things like that) and they all agree in that the JavaScript Runtime is "something like, like ... an ancient knowledge, pretty hard to understand and to acquire. It's like, like magic ... "

  Keep by my side in this magical journey where we will go from the JavaScript RuneTime to the JavaScript Runtime and will unveil its magic !

## Getting Started With Language-Oriented Programming

Data is probably the most valuable and requested asset all over the world. We humans are eager to consume it and are constantly looking for ever-complex, accurate, specific data sets to increase our knowledge stock and keep it up to date. Whether application logs aggregation analysis, trading market rates comparison or simply the weather forecast analysis, general-purpose languages cannot fully provide users with the best tools for interacting, retrieving and solving domain related problems within the context a domain expert would expect to. We will drive a general introduction to this topic during the first part and will get into the job by designing and implementing a nice case example domain specific language for fetching Github issues in the second part.
